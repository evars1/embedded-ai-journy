# Embedded AI Journey

## Career Goal
I aim to become an Electrical & Electronics Engineer specializing in Embedded AI and Computer Vision systems that interact with the real world.

## Why This Field?
AI alone is not enough. Real-time systems, hardware constraints, and safety-critical applications require engineering skills that will remain valuable in the future.

## Current Status
This repository documents my learning journey from zero to real-world embedded AI applications.

## Planned Topics
- Python fundamentals
- Computer vision basics
- Embedded systems (Jetson / edge devices)
- Real-time AI applications
